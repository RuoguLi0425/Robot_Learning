        "This project aims to demonstrate how neural networks can be used in a robotics setting. We will continue using the 2D maze environment introduced in Project 1 and learn to navigate an agent to a goal. However, since neural networks can be more powerful models than the ones we had access to previously, we can afford to make some changes to the 2D maze environment and make the problem more difficult.  This project consists of three parts. In Part I, you will be training a simple DNN, which will take as input the agent position and goal position. In Parts II and III, you will be training CNNs which take as input an image of the environment, with the agent the goal depicted on it.\n",

        "- **Training time**: To keep auto-grading feasible, your total training time must be strictly under 3 mins, 15mins, and 10 mins for parts 1, 2, and 3. These time budgets are more than enough to achieve full credits on this project. Note that longer training time does not necessarily mean higher performance because of overfitting. The faster your network trains the better!\n",
        "- **Memory usage**: Make sure your code does not require too much memory. The required amount of RAM for this assignment should not be more than 8GB.\n",
        "- **NO GPU**: No GPU is required or allowed for this assignment.\n",
        "- **Reproducibility**: We have ensured that the randomness of the environment is deterministic. To get reproducible scores you must ensure your model training and prediction are also reproducible. The randomly initialized weights of the neural network should be made repeatable using seeding. You can add PyTorch seeding method below and see [PyTorch Reproducibility](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html) to learn more.\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  import torch\n",
        "  torch.manual_seed(0)\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "- **Classifier**: In all the parts we are training a neural network to solve a classification problem and it is important to use a reasonable loss function. For example, the MSE (mean squared classification) error has drawbacks related to sensitivity. Cross entropy loss usually has good performance for classification tasks and you can find the documentation for it [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html#torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss) and is further explained below. However, note that you are free to use any loss function you like.\n",
        "  - Cross entropy is a concept from information theory which is defined for two probability distributions. Cross entropy is minimum when the two distributions involved are the same and this is the property that makes it useful as a loss function in the context of machine learning. The idea is to minimize the cross entropy between the prediction distribution and the label distribution. For our case where we are training a neural network for classification, we can have the network output a score for each action. Cross entropy can be computed from these scores by converting to probability values (using softmax) and comparing it with the label distribution. The label distribution is obtained simply by assigning a probability of 1 to ground truth action and 0 to all other actions. Once trained, the best action can found by just choosing the action with the highest probability (i.e., the highest score) as predicted by the network.\n",
        "- **Optimizer**: While it is possible to use a simple optimizer to achieve the desired accuracy, the training time can be quite high. There exist a number of optimizers implemented in PyTorch that have much faster convergence.\n",
        "- **Parameter tuning**: Keep your architectures simple and slowly add complexity (more layers/kernels) to improve accuracy. Remember \"To Err is Human\" and the expert data (collected by a human) that you are training on is not perfect. Having a 100% training accuracy (very small training loss) might not be the best for achieving the highest score. So make sure your model does not overfit during training.\n",
        "- **PyTorch input shape**: Notice that the expected input shape to CONV2D in PyTorch is (N, C, H, W), where N is the batch size, C is the number of channels, H is the image height and W is the image width. You will need to switch axes for the incoming images in order for them to be correctly passed to the first convolution layer."
