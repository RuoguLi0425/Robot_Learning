Robot Learning consists of five sub-projects, with the difficulty level increasing from project to project. Each sub-project contains a Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`) with detailed instructions for the specific project.

For sub-projects 3 and 4, you can download and verify the datasets corresponding to the dynamic models from the following links:
