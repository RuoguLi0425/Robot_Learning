The state of the arm is a 2n-dimensional vector : n joint positions [rad] + n joint velocities [rad/s] and the action is defined as the n torques (in N-m) applied to n joints respectively.\n",

        "1. You can use your MPC Controller in your data collection to gather better training samples\n",
        "2. A good cost function to evaluate your trajectory in MPC is very important and you can use both distance and velocity metrics to define the cost function.\n",
        "3. As mentioned in the lecture, a constant torque with pseudo gradients seems to work well for this project. You can also use multiple delta values to gather more trajectories to choose from.\n",
        "4. Since we are passing the MPC object to the controller you can instantiate the MPC class with different parameters like the planning horizon, delta values etc.\n",
        "5. To speed up data collection, avoid using np.concatenate(), np.stack() or np.append() like functions on your X and Y arrays. Instead, initialize X and Y arrays with all zeros using the correct shape and then fill in the values one by one. This is much faster in numpy"
